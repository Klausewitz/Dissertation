This is the dissertation project for Cardiff University master degree in MSc Computing

In traditional ride-hailing routing, the shortest driving distance from the pickup point to the drop-off point is usually prioritized. However, this may cause possible walking shortcuts to be ignored, and the hailed vehicles are forced to take detours.

Based on this fact, this study proposes a new pick-up and drop-off point optimization and routing algorithm based on the bidirectional A\* algorithm, which utilizes the time passengers wait for ride-hailing vehicles to take a walk and takes the total travel time as a constraint to bypass the detour in the city. The algorithm is expected to reduce passengers' time in the car and fare without spending much cost and avoid online ridehailing vehicles from entering congestion, one-way streets and unnecessary detours. For the online ride-hailing industry, it can improve vehicle operation efficiency, expand the potential users, reduce mileage and carbon emissions, enhance industry competitiveness and promote sustainable development of the industry.

To validate the effectiveness of the algorithm, this study uses taxi datasets in three cities: New York, San Francisco, and Chengdu for simulation experiments. The results show that in most cases, the algorithm provides a success rate of more than 90% within an acceptable running time. For the 2% to 7% of the total trips with detours, the average mileage can be reduced by 23% to 30% and the total travel time by about 2% to 10%. The mileage of the car-hailing industry can be reduced by 0.2% to 1.2%. In addition, the study also speculates that different urban structures and urban planning will have a significant impact on the detour rate, mileage reduction and other figures related to vehicle detours.
